Implementing Semantic Theories

This repository has the code for the Chapter on Implementing Semantic Theories in 
the second edition of the "Handbook of Contemporary Semantics", edited by Shalom 
Lappin and Chris Fox. 

In order to play with the code, first download and install The Haskell Platform from 
www.haskell.org. Next, download the file IST.hs, open a terminal, and type: 

$ ghci 

followed by return. 

Note that $ is the system prompt. You should type what is to the right
of the prompt. 

Enjoy!
